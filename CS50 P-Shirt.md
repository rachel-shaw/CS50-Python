After finishing CS50 itself, students on campus at Harvard traditionally receive their very own [I took CS50](https://cs50.harvardshop.com/collections/print/products/i-took-cs50-unisex-t-shirt) t-shirt. No need to buy one online, but like to try one on virtually?

In a file called `shirt.py`, implement a program that expects exactly two command-line arguments:

- in `sys.argv[1]`, the name (or path) of a JPEG or PNG to read (i.e., open) as input
- in `sys.argv[2]`, the name (or path) of a JPEG or PNG to write (i.e., save) as output

The program should then overlay [shirt.png](https://cs50.harvard.edu/python/2022/psets/6/shirt/shirt.png) (which has a transparent background) on the input after resizing and cropping the input to be the same size, saving the result as its output.

Open the input with `Image.open`, per [pillow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/reference/Image.html#PIL.Image.open](https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/reference/Image.html#PIL.Image.open), resize and crop the input with `ImageOps.fit`, per [pillow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/reference/ImageOps.html#PIL.ImageOps.fit](https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/reference/ImageOps.html#PIL.ImageOps.fit), using default values for `method`, `bleed`, and `centering`, overlay the shirt with `Image.paste`, per [pillow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/reference/Image.html#PIL.Image.Image.paste](https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/reference/Image.html#PIL.Image.Image.paste), and save the result with `Image.save`, per [pillow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/reference/Image.html#PIL.Image.Image.save](https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/reference/Image.html#PIL.Image.Image.save).

The program should instead exit via `sys.exit`:

- if the user does not specify exactly two command-line arguments,
- if the input’s and output’s names do not end in `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, or `.png`, case-insensitively,
- if the input’s name does not have the same extension as the output’s name, or
- if the specified input does not exist.

Assume that the input will be a photo of someone posing in just the right way, like [these demos](https://cs50.harvard.edu/python/2022/psets/6/shirt/#demos), so that, when they’re resized and cropped, the shirt appears to fit perfectly.

If you’d like to run your program on a photo of yourself, first drag the photo over to VS Code’s file explorer, into the same folder as `shirt.py`. No need to submit any photos with your code. But, if you would like, you’re welcome (but not expected) to share a photo of yourself wearing your virtual shirt in any of [CS50’s communities](https://cs50.harvard.edu/python/communities)!

#### Hints
- Note that you can determine a file’s extension with `os.path.splitext`, per [docs.python.org/3/library/os.path.html#os.path.splitext](https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.path.html#os.path.splitext).
- Note that `open` can `raise` a `FileNotFoundError`, per [docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#FileNotFoundError](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#FileNotFoundError).
- Note that the `Pillow` package comes with quite a few classes and methods, per [pypi.org/project/Pillow](https://pypi.org/project/Pillow/). You might find its [handbook](https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/handbook/) and [reference](https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/reference/) helpful to skim. You can install the package with:
    
    ```
    pip install Pillow
    ```
    
    You can open an image (e.g., `shirt.png`) with code like:
    
    ```
    shirt = Image.open("shirt.png")
    ```
    
    You can get the width and height, respectively, of that image as a `tuple` with code like:
    
    ```
    size = shirt.size
    ```
    
    And you can overlay that image on top of another (e.g., `photo`) with code like
    
    ```
    photo.paste(shirt, shirt)
    ```
    
    wherein the first `shirt` represents the image to overlay and the second `shirt` represents a “mask” indicating which pixels in `photo` to update.
    
- Note that you can open an image (e.g., `shirt.png`) in VS Code by running
    
    ```
    code shirt.png
    ```
    
    or by double-clicking its icon in VS Code’s file explorer.

#### After

## Before You Begin

Log into [cs50.dev](https://cs50.dev/), click on your terminal window, and execute `cd` by itself. You should find that your terminal window’s prompt resembles the below:

```
$
```

Next execute

```
mkdir shirt
```

to make a folder called `shirt` in your codespace.

Then execute

```
cd shirt
```

to change directories into that folder. You should now see your terminal prompt as `shirt/ $`. You can now execute

```
code shirt.py
```

to make a file called `shirt.py` where you’ll write your program. Be sure to run

```
wget https://cs50.harvard.edu/python/2022/psets/6/shirt/shirt.png
```

to download [shirt.png](https://cs50.harvard.edu/python/2022/psets/6/shirt/shirt.png). Also be sure to run

```
wget https://cs50.harvard.edu/python/2022/psets/6/shirt/muppets.zip
```

to download [muppets.zip](https://cs50.harvard.edu/python/2022/psets/6/shirt/muppets.zip) into your folder. You can run

```
unzip muppets.zip
```

to extract a collection of muppet photos!

## How to Test

Here’s how to test your code manually:

- Run your program with `python shirt.py`. Your program should exit using `sys.exit` and provide an error message:
    
    ```
    Too few command-line arguments   
    ```
    
- Be sure to download [muppets.zip](https://cs50.harvard.edu/python/2022/psets/6/shirt/muppets.zip) and extract a collection of muppet photos using `unzip muppets.zip`. Run your program with `python shirt.py before1.jpg before2.jpg before3.jpg`. Your program should output:
    
    ```
    Too many command-line arguments
    ```
    
- Run your program with `python shirt.py before1.jpg invalid_format.bmp`. Your program should exit using `sys.exit` and provide an error message:
    
    ```
    Invalid output
    ```
    
- Run your program with `python shirt.py before1.jpg after1.png`. Your program should exit using `sys.exit` and provide an error message:
    
    ```
    Input and output have different extensions
    ```
    
- Run your program with `python shirt.py non_existent_image.jpg after1.jpg`. Your program should exit using `sys.exit` and provide an error message:
    
    ```
    Input does not exist
    ```
    
- Run your program with `python shirt.py before1.jpg after1.jpg`. Assuming you’ve downloaded and unzipped [muppets.zip](https://cs50.harvard.edu/python/2022/psets/6/shirt/muppets.zip), your program should create an image like the below:  
    ![after|175](https://cs50.harvard.edu/python/2022/psets/6/shirt/after1.jpg)

You can execute the below to check your code using `check50`, a program that CS50 will use to test your code when you submit. But be sure to test it yourself as well!

```
check50 cs50/problems/2022/python/shirt
```

Green smilies mean your program has passed a test! Red frownies will indicate your program output something unexpected. Visit the URL that `check50` outputs to see the input `check50` handed to your program, what output it expected, and what output your program actually gave.

## How to Submit

In your terminal, execute the below to submit your work.

```
submit50 cs50/problems/2022/python/shirt
```
