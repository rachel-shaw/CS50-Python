Before there were emoji, there were [emoticons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_emoticons), whereby text like `:)` was a happy face and text like `:(` was a sad face. Nowadays, programs tend to convert emoticons to emoji automatically!

In a file called `faces.py`, implement a function called `convert` that accepts a `str` as input and returns that same input with any `:)` converted to ![🙂|15](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/twitter/twemoji@14.0.2/assets/72x72/1f642.png) (otherwise known as a [slightly smiling face](https://emojipedia.org/slightly-smiling-face/)) and any `:(` converted to ![🙁|15](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/twitter/twemoji@14.0.2/assets/72x72/1f641.png) (otherwise known as a [slightly frowning face|](https://emojipedia.org/slightly-frowning-face/)). All other text should be returned unchanged.

Then, in that same file, implement a function called `main` that prompts the user for input, calls `convert` on that input, and prints the result. You’re welcome, but not required, to prompt the user explicitly, as by passing a `str` of your own as an argument to `input`. Be sure to call `main` at the bottom of your file.

#### Hints
- Recall that `input` returns a `str`, per [docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#input](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#input).
- Recall that a `str` comes with quite a few methods, per [docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#string-methods](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#string-methods).
- An emoji is actually just a character, so you can quote it like any `str`, a la `"![😐](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/twitter/twemoji@14.0.2/assets/72x72/1f610.png)"`. And you can copy and paste the emoji from this page into your own code as needed.

## Before You Begin

Execute `cd` by itself in your terminal window. You should find that your terminal window’s prompt resembles the below:

```
$
```

Next execute

```
mkdir faces
```

to make a folder called `faces` in your codespace.

Then execute

```
cd faces
```

to change directories into that folder. You should now see your terminal prompt as `faces/ $`. You can now execute

```
code faces.py
```

to make a file called `faces.py` where you’ll write your program.

## Demo
```
$ python faces.py
hello :)
hello 🙂

$ python faces.py
goodbye :(
goodbye 🙁

$
```

## How to Test

Here’s how to test your code manually:

- Run your program with `python faces.py`. Type `Hello :)` and press Enter. Your program should output:
    
    ```
    Hello 🙂
    ```
    
- Run your program with `python faces.py`. Type `Goodbye :(` and press Enter. Your program should output:
    
    ```
    Goodbye 🙁
    ```
    
- Run your program with `python faces.py`. Type `Hello :) Goodbye :(` and press Enter. Your program should output
    
    ```
    Hello 🙂 Goodbye 🙁
    ```
    

You can execute the below to check your code using `check50`, a program that CS50 will use to test your code when you submit. But be sure to test it yourself as well!

```
check50 cs50/problems/2022/python/faces
```

Green smilies mean your program has passed a test! Red frownies will indicate your program output something unexpected. Visit the URL that `check50` outputs to see the input `check50` handed to your program, what output it expected, and what output your program actually gave.

## [How to Submit](https://cs50.harvard.edu/python/2022/psets/0/faces/#how-to-submit)

In your terminal, execute the below to submit your work.

```
submit50 cs50/problems/2022/python/faces
```
